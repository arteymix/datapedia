# Datapedia
Datapedia is a Wikipedia-like website designed for providing raw data instead of human-readable articles. The key point of this project is make data easily accessible for any developers.

It is designed in a non-regressive way, which means that if your application is binded to datapedia, it shall theoritically never breaks. This is done through recursive analysis of data structure to ensure that no type has changed. Data can get more complex, but are always retrocompatible.

Official documentation is available within the project.

## Installing
To install datapedia on your computer, you need Python with the Flask framework.
